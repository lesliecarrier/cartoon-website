# About

Welcome to OstrichZero comics, where you can follow the ongoing adventures of self-entitled A-Bear,
seethe in anger towards Passive Aggressive Poodle, loathe Mondays with Disgusted Owl, share a happy hour beer with BizDev Koala, or just laugh at
Gertie the Dove's awkward misfortunes.  

I also have a webcomic series I started in 2012 that should be up soon!


# Characters
- **A-Bear**: Lives life with the occasional self-absorbed bumps along the way. Why the "A-" before the "Bear"? Because the name Bear was taken.
- **Gertie**: "HOOO HOOO"
- **BizDev Koala**: Just some koala in a business suit.
- **Passive Aggressive Poodle**: What life is complete without someone out there trying to get the satisfaction that they're ruining yours?  
- **Disgusted Owl**: Everyday is a Monday for Disgusted Owl.

# From OstrichZero
These are just some cartoons I enjoy drawing in my free time. I've drawn many 'birthday cards' in the last few years of peoples' pets in some wacky cartoon and thought maybe I could tie that in with daily life. If some of them make you smile or even groan like you've read a stupid pun joke, then maybe I'm doing something right. Thanks for reading!
