<h1>About</h1>

Welcome to OstrichZero comics, where you can follow the ongoing adventures of self-entitled A-Bear,
seethe in anger towards Passive Aggressive Poodle, loathe Mondays with Disgusted Owl, share a happy hour beer with BizDev Koala, or just laugh at
Gertie the Dove's awkward misfortunes.  

I also have a webcomic series I started in 2012 that should be up soon!


<h1>Characters</h1>
A-Bear: Lives life with the occasional self-absorbed bumps along the way. Why the "A-" before the "Bear"? Because the name Bear was taken.
<br />
Gertie: "HOOO HOOO"
<br />
BizDev Koala: Just some koala in a business suit.
<br />
Passive Aggressive Poodle: What life is complete without someone out there trying to get the satisfaction that they're ruining yours?  
Disgusted Owl: Everyday is a Monday for Disgusted Owl.

<h1>From OstrichZero</h1>
These are just some cartoons I enjoy drawing in my free time. I've drawn many 'birthday cards' in the last few years of peoples' pets in some wacky cartoon and thought maybe I could tie that in with daily life. If some of them make you smile or even groan like you've read a stupid pun joke, then maybe I'm doing something right. Thanks for reading!
